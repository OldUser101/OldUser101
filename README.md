# Hi, I'm Nathan 👋

I'm a student interested in software engineering across systems programming
and web development.

***

A couple of things I'm working on that one might be interested in:

- [nlock](https://github.com/OldUser101/nlock): A customisable, minimalist
    Wayland screen locker
- [nathanjgill.uk](https://github.com/OldUser101/nathanjgill.uk): The third
    iteration of my website, built with ...
- [tars](https://github.com/OldUser101/tars): A fast and simple static site
    generator in Rust

- I help with RoboCon, a robotics competition for GCSE students in the UK.
    Check out [@systemetric](https://github.com/systemetric)!

- You can pronounce my username in a few ways, namely:
  - "Old user one-oh-one"
  - "Old user five"
  - "Old user minus three"

  Take your pick.
